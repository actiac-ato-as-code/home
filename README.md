# ACT-IAC ATO-as-Code: Home

This home repository serves as place to request support or ask questions about the overall setup of the organization.

Create an issue for anything you need or any questions you have and we'll do our best to support.

## Repository Layout

It's early days, but for now each working group (`Tech/Data`, `Process`, `Business`) has its own repositoey, e.g. `aac-techdata`. This will allow those groups to capture notes, contents, issues.

Other repositories may be created as needed; just create an issue in this repository to ask about it and we'll discuss and set things up.
