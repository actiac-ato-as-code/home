## Repository Layout

It's early days, but for now each working group (`Tech/Data`, `Process`, `Business`) has its own repositoey, e.g. `aac-techdata`. This will allow those groups to capture notes, contents, issues.

Other repositories may be created as needed; just create an issue in this repository to ask about it and we'll discuss and set things up.
